## Additional Notes
* This is a new CRAN submission.
* In the initial attempt, there were two significant issues:
  * A few more links throughout used `http`; these have been moved to `https`
    or otherwise changed entirely.
  * The old URL `https://sl3.tlverse.org` has been replaced by a corrected
    version `https://tlverse.org/sl3/`
  * Changing of user options via calls to `options()` in the vignettes have
    been removed entirely.
