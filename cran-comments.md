## Additional notes
* This is a resubmission of a package removed from CRAN due to a Solaris build
  failure (no longer part of the CRAN build/check suite) that affected one of
  its upstream dependencies (`hal9001`).
* The upstream dependencies `hal9001` and `haldensify` have both recently been
  re-uploaded to CRAN.
