Description: Facilitates computation of targeted maximum likelihood estimates of
    population-level causal effects of additive interventions of stochastically
    assigned exposures, based on a causal parameter defined in the context of
    stochastic treatment regimes. Both iterative and one-step variations of the
    TML estimator are implemented.
