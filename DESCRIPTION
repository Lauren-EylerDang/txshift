Description: Efficient estimation of the population-level causal effects of
    stochastic interventions on a continuous-valued treatment node. Both
    one-step and targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimators are implemented
    for a causal parameter defined as the counterfactual mean of the outcome of
    interest under a stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural
    value of the treatment. To accommodate settings in which two-phase sampling
    is employed, procedures for making use of inverse probability of censoring
    weights are provided to facilitate construction of inefficient and efficient
    one-step and TML estimators.
