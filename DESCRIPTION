Description: Computation of targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimates of the
    population-level causal effect of a continuous-valued intervention based on
    a simple stochastic assignment mechanism, defined as the counterfactual mean
    of the outcome of interest under a location shift of the observed (natural)
    value of the intervention. To accommodate applications in which two-phase
    sampling is employed, an inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW)
    TML estimator for the counterfactual mean under the stochastic intervention
    is made available, alongside procedures allowing the robust estimation of
    nuisance parameters in a manner that ensures full nonparametric efficiency
    of the resultant IPCW-TML estimator of the causal parameter.
