> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

**Authors:** [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org) and [David
Benkeser](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#!dbenkes)

## What’s `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities for the
construction of efficient estimators of a causal parameter defined as
the counterfactual mean of an outcome under stochastic mechanisms for
treatment assignment (Díaz and van der Laan 2012). `txshift` implements
and builds upon a simplified algorithm for the targeted maximum
likelihood (TML) estimator of such a causal parameter, originally
proposed by Díaz and van der Laan (2018), and makes use of analogous
machinery to compute an efficient one-step estimator (Pfanzagl and
Wefelmeyer 1985). `txshift` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) (Coyle et al. 2020) to allow
for ensemble machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation
procedure.

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials),
observed data is often subject to a two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e.,
through the use of a two-stage design). In such cases, efficient
estimators (of both varieties) must be augmented to construct unbiased
estimates of the population-level causal parameter. Rose and van der
Laan (2011) first introduced an augmentation procedure that relies on
introducing inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights directly to
an appropriate loss function or to the efficient influence function
estimating equation. `txshift` extends this approach to compute
IPC-weighted one-step and TML estimators of the counterfactual mean
under a stochastic treatment regime.

## Installation

Install the most recent *stable release* from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

``` r
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/txshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a
treatment, consider the following example:

``` r
library(txshift)
library(haldensify)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 1000
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = 2 * W, sd = 1)
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)))

# now, let's introduce a a two-stage sampling process
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit the full-data TMLE (ignoring two-phase sampling)
tmle <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                estimator = "tmle",
                g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                  n_bins = 5,
                                  grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
                Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                  glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
               )

# fit a full-data one-step estimator for comparison (again, no sampling)
os <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
              estimator = "onestep",
              g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",

                                glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
             )
