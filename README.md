## What’s `txshift`?

`txshift` is an R package that makes it easy to compute targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of the population-level causal effects of
interventions based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment.

  - Original estimator and iterative algorithm proposed in Muñoz and van
    der Laan (2012)
  - One-step estimation procedure and algorithm introduced in Díaz and
    van der Laan (2017).
  - See van der Laan and Rose (2017) for a discussion on recent
    developments in Targeted Learning.
  - See van der Laan and Rose (2011) for an introduction to Targeted
    Learning.

## Installation

Install the most recent *stable release* from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

``` r
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/txshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

-----

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a
treatment, consider the following example:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
#> ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──
#> ✔ ggplot2 2.2.1.9000     ✔ purrr   0.2.4     
#> ✔ tibble  1.4.2          ✔ dplyr   0.7.4     
#> ✔ tidyr   0.7.2.9000     ✔ stringr 1.2.0.9000
#> ✔ readr   1.1.1          ✔ forcats 0.2.0
#> ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
#> ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
#> ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# induce censoring
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W))

# fit the TMLE

                           fluc_method = "standard",
                           mod_args = list(

                                          glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          ))
