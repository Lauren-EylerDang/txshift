> Targeted Learning of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

## What’s `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to compute targeted maximum
likelihood (TML) estimates of the counterfactual mean of an outcome
under stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment and related causal
parameters (Díaz and van der Laan (2012)). In particular, `txshift`
implements and builds upon a simplified algorithm for the TML estimator
proposed by Díaz and van der Laan (2018).

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials), it is
often the case that the observed data structure is generated under a
two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e., a two-stage design). In such cases,
TML estimators must be augmented to exhibit efficiency in spite of the
challenges induced by the censoring process. An appropriate augmentation
procedure was first proposed by Rose and van der Laan (2011), who
proposed the use of inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW)
alongside an augmentation of the relevant efficient influence function.
`txshift` extends this approach to computing one-step and IPCW-TML
estimators of the counterfactual mean under a stochastic treatment
regime.

## Installation

Install the most recent *stable release* from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

``` r
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/txshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

-----

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a
treatment, consider the following example:

``` r
library(txshift)
library(haldensify)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 1000
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = 2 * W, sd = 1)
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)))

# fit the TMLE
tmle <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                estimator = "tmle",
                g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                  n_bins = 5,
                                  grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
                Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                  glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
               )
summary(tmle)

#>     n_iter 
#>          0

# fit a one-step estimator for comparison
os <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
              estimator = "onestep",
              g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                n_bins = 5,
                                grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
              Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
             )
summary(os)
#>      lwr_ci   param_est      upr_ci   param_var    eif_mean   estimator

#>      n_iter 
#>           0

# now, let's introduce a censoring process (for two-stage sampling)
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for this censoring process:
ipcw_tmle <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                     C = C, V = c("W", "Y"),

                    )
