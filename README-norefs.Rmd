## What's `txshift`?

`txshift` is an R package that makes it easy to compute targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of the population-level causal effects of interventions
based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment.

---

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/txshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example}
library(tidyverse)
library(condensier)
library(txshift)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# induce censoring
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W))

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                           fluc_method = "standard",
                           mod_args = list(
                             g_fit = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                          nbins = 25,  bin_method = "dhist",
                                          bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new(),
                                          parfit = FALSE),
                             Q_fit = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                          glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          ))

# examine the results
tmle_shift

# compute the confidence interval and view the results
(ci_shift <- confint(tmle_shift))
```
