## What's `shifttx`?

`shifttx` is an R package that makes it easy to compute targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of the population-level causal effects of interventions
based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment.

* Original estimator and iterative algorithm proposed in @munoz2012population
* One-step estimation procedure and algorithm introduced in @diaz2017stochastic.
* See @vdl2017targeted for a discussion on recent developments in Targeted
  Learning.
* See @vdl2011targeted for an introduction to Targeted Learning.

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/shifttx")
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `shifttx` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example}
library(shifttx)

# first, define simulation parameters and observed data
n <- 100
W <- data.frame(W1 = runif(n), W2 = rbinom(n, 1, 0.7))
A <- rpois(n, lambda = exp(3 + 0.3 * log(W$W1) - 0.2 * exp(W$W1) * W$W2))
Y <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(-1 + 0.05 * A - 0.02 * A * W$W2 + 0.2 * A * tan(W$W1^2)
                         - 0.02 * W$W1 * W$W2 + 0.1 * A * W$W1 * W$W2))
fitA.0 <- glm(A ~ I(log(W1)) + I(exp(W1)):W2, family = poisson,
              data = data.frame(A, W))
fitY.0 <- glm(Y ~ A + A:W2 + A:I(tan(W1^2)) + W1:W2 + A:W1:W2,
              family = binomial, data = data.frame(A, W))

# next, we define the treatment mechanisma and outcome in the true model
gn.0  <- function(A = A, W = W) {
  dpois(A, lambda = predict(fitA.0, newdata = W, type = "response"))
}
Qn.0 <- function(A = A, W = W) {
  predict(fitY.0, newdata = data.frame(A, W, row.names = NULL),
          type = "response")
}

# finally, we may compute targeted estimates of the intervention effect
est_target <- tmle_shift(Y = Y, A = A, W = W, Qn = Qn.0, gn = gn.0, delta = 2,
                         tol = 1e-4, iter_max = 5, A_val = seq(1, 60, 1))

# let's just examine the first few results
head(est_target)
```
