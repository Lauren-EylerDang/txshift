> Targeted Learning of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

## What's `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities to compute targeted
maximum likelihood estimates (TMLE) of the population-level causal effect of
interventions based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment
(@diaz2012population). As opposed to the original algorithm given for computing
such a TMLE, `txshift ` implements and builds upon subsequent work by
@diaz2018stochastic, who reveal a simplified algorithm for computing the TML
estimator of the shift intervention causal effect parameter.

For many practical applications (e.g., observational medical studies), it is
often the case that the data structure of interest is generated by a selective
sampling process (i.e., a two-stage design). In such cases, TML estimators may
be augmented to cope with -- and even exhibit efficiency -- in spite of the
challenges induced by such an artificial censoring process. This augmentation
procedure is done by way of adding inverse probability of censoring weights
(IPCW), which leads to an IPCW-TMLE, originally proposed by
@rose2011targeted2sd. `txshift` extends the approach of computing IPCW-TMLEs to
the shift intervention causal effect parameter.

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(txshift)
library(condensier)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                           g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             nbins = 25,
                                             bin_method = "dhist",
                                             bin_estimator =
                                               speedglmR6$new(),
                                             parfit = FALSE),
                           Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          )

# conveniently summarize the results
summary(tmle_shift)

# now, let's introduce a censoring process (for two-stage sampling)
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for this censoring process:
ipcwtmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                               C = C, V = c("W", "Y"),
                               max_iter = 10,  # limit iterations for speed
                               ipcw_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
                               g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                                 nbins = 25,
                                                 bin_method = "dhist",
                                                 bin_estimator =
                                                   speedglmR6$new(),
                                                 parfit = FALSE),
                               Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                                 glm_formula = "Y ~ ."),
                               eif_reg_spec = FALSE  # fit EIF with a GLM
                              )

# conveniently summarize the results
