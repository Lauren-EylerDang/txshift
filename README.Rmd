> Targeted Learning of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

## What's `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities for the construction
of efficient estimators of a causal parameter defined as the counterfactual mean
of an outcome under stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment
[@diaz2012population]. `txshift ` implements and builds upon a simplified
algorithm for the targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator of such a causal
parameter, originally proposed by @diaz2018stochastic, and makes use of
analogous machinery to compute an efficient one-step estimator
[@pfanzagl1985contributions]. `txshift` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle2019sl3] to allow for (ensemble)
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure.

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials), observed data
is often subject to a two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e., through the use of a
two-stage design). In such cases, efficient estimators (of both varieties) must
be augmented to construct unbiased estimates of the population-level causal
parameter. @rose2011targeted2sd first introduced an augmentation procedure that
relies on introducing inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights directly to
an appropriate loss function or to the efficient influence function estimating
equation. `txshift` extends this approach to compute IPC-weighted one-step and
TML estimators of the counterfactual mean under a stochastic treatment regime.

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(txshift)
library(haldensify)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 1000
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = 2 * W, sd = 1)
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)))

# now, let's introduce a a two-stage sampling process
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit the full-data TMLE (ignoring two-phase sampling)
tmle <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                estimator = "tmle",
                g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                  n_bins = 5,
                                  grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                  lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
                Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                  glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
               )
summary(tmle)

# fit a full-data one-step estimator for comparison (again, no sampling)
os <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
              estimator = "onestep",
              g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                n_bins = 5,
                                grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                lambda_seq = exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
              Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
             )
summary(os)

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for the two-phase sampling process
ipcw_tmle <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                     C = C, V = c("W", "Y"),
                     estimator = "tmle",
                     max_iter = 5,
                     ipcw_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
                     g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "hal",
                                       n_bins = 5,
                                       grid_type = "equal_mass",
                                       lambda_seq =
                                         exp(seq(-1, -9, length = 300))),
                     Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                       glm_formula = "Y ~ ."),
                     eif_reg_type = "glm"
                    )
summary(ipcw_tmle)

# compare with an IPCW-agumented one-step estimator under two-phase sampling
ipcw_os <- txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                   C = C, V = c("W", "Y"),

                  )
