## What's `shifttx`?

`shifttx` is an R package that makes it easy to compute targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of the population-level causal effects of interventions
based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment.

* Original estimator and iterative algorithm proposed in @munoz2012population
* One-step estimation procedure and algorithm introduced in @diaz2017stochastic.
* See @vdl2017targeted for a discussion on recent developments in Targeted
  Learning.
* See @vdl2011targeted for an introduction to Targeted Learning.

## Installation

Install the most recent _stable release_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/shifttx")
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `shifttx` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example}
library(sl3)
library(condensier)
library(shifttx)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
set.seed(429153)
n_obs <- 1000
n_w <- 1
a1_mean <- 2
a0_mean <- 0

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5)))

## set and organize treatment based on baseline W
A1 <- rnorm(length(which(W == 1)), mean = a1_mean, sd = 1)
A0 <- rnorm(length(which(W == 0)), mean = a0_mean, sd = 1)
A <- rep(NA, n_obs)
A[which(W == 0)] <- A0
A[which(W == 1)] <- A1

# create outcome
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs)

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_shifttx(W = W,
                           A = A,
                           Y = Y,
                           delta = 0.5,
                           g_fit_args = list(nbins = 20,
                                             bin_method = "dhist",
                                             bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new(),
                                             parfit = FALSE),
                           Q_fit_args = list(fit_method = "sl",
                                             glm_formula = "Y ~ .",
                                             sl_learners = c("mean",
                                                             "glm_fast"),
                                             sl_metalearner = "nnls"),
                           fluc_method = "standard",
                           eif_tol = 1e-7
                          )
# examine the results
tmle_shift

# compute the confidence interval and view the results
(ci_shift <- confint(tmle_shift))
```
