## What's `txshift`?

`txshift` is an R package that makes it easy to compute targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of the population-level causal effects of interventions
based on stochastic mechanisms for treatment assignment. The shift intervention
causal parameter implemented in this package was first formalized by
@munoz2012population, who propose a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE)
as well as an iterative algorithm for computing their given estimator.
Subsequent work by @diaz2017stochastic revealed a simplified algorithm for
computing the TML estimator for this shift intervention parameter, the
implementation of which is the core contribution of this R package.

For many practical applications (e.g., observational medical studies), it is
often the case that the data structure of interest is generated by a selective
sampling process (i.e., a two-stage design). In such cases, TML estimators may
be augmented to cope with -- and even obtain efficiency -- despite this induced
censoring process by way of an IPCW-TMLE, as originally proposed by
@rose2011targeted2sd. An IPCW-TMLE extension for the shift intervention
parameter is also implemented here.

For background on the Targeted Learning methodology, as well as recent advances,
the canonical references that ought to be consulted are @vdl2011targeted and
@vdl2017targeted.

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example}
library(tidyverse)
library(condensier)
library(txshift)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# induce censoring
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W))

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                           fluc_method = "standard",
                           g_fit = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                        nbins = 25,  bin_method = "dhist",
                                        bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new(),
                                        parfit = FALSE),
                           Q_fit = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                        glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          )

# conveniently summarize the results
summary(tmle_shift)
```
