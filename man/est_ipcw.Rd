\usage{
est_ipcw(V, Delta, fit_type = c("sl", "glm"), glm_formula = "Delta ~ .",
  sl_lrnrs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{V}{...}

\item{Delta}{...}

\item{fit_type}{A \code{character} indicating whether to perform the fit
using GLMs or a Super Learner. If use of Super Learner is desired, then the
argument \code{sl_lrnrs} must be provided.}

\item{glm_formula}{...}

\item{sl_lrnrs}{An \code{R6} object of class \code{Lrnr_sl}, a Super Learner
object created externally using the \code{sl3} package.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing a \code{numeric} vector corresponding to the
 inverse probability of censoring weights that are required for computing an
 IPCW-TMLE and \code{numeric} vector of the estimated missingness mechanism.
 Formally, the former is nothing more than %\frac{\Delta}{\Pi_n}, where the
 term %\Pi_n is simply the predicted probability of belonging to a censoring
 class as computed using standard logistic regression.
