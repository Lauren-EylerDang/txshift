\title{Compute Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimate of Counterfactual Mean Under
Shifted Treatment}
\usage{
tmle_txshift(data_internal, C = rep(1, nrow(data_internal)), V = NULL,
  delta, cens_weights, cens_weights_norm, ipcw_estim, Qn_estim, Hn_estim,
  fluc_method = c("standard", "weighted"),
  eif_tol = 1/nrow(data_internal), max_iter = 10000,
  eif_reg_type = c("hal", "glm"), ipcw_fit_args,
  ipcw_efficiency = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_internal}{A \code{data.table} constructed internally by a call to
\code{txshift}. This contains most of the data elements needed for computing
the targeted maximum likelihood estimator.}

\item{C}{A \code{numeric} binary vector giving information on whether a given
observation was subject to censoring. This is used to compute an IPCW-TMLE
in cases where two-stage sampling is performed. The default assumes that no
censoring was present (i.e., a two-stage design was NOT used). N.B., this is
equivalent to the term %\Delta in the notation used in the original Rose and
van der Laan manuscript that introduced/formulated IPCW-TML estimators.}

\item{V}{The covariates that are used in determining the sampling procedure
that gives rise to censoring. The default is \code{NULL} and corresponds to
scenarios in which there is no censoring (in which case all values in the
preceding argument \code{C} must be uniquely 1. To specify this, pass in a
NAMED \code{list} identifying variables amongst W, A, Y that are thought to
have played a role in defining the sampling/censoring mechanism (C).}

\item{delta}{A \code{numeric} value indicating the shift in the treatment to
be used in defining the target parameter. This is defined with respect to
the scale of the treatment (A).}

\item{cens_weights}{A \code{numeric} vector that gives inverse probability of
censoring weights for each observation. These are generated by invoking the
routines for estimating the censoring mechanism.}

\item{cens_weights_norm}{A normalized version of the preceding argument
\code{cens_weights}, wherein the weights are scaled such that they sum to
the unit value.}

\item{ipcw_estim}{An object providing the value of the censoring mechanism
evaluated across the full data. This object is passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function \code{est_ipcw}.}

\item{Qn_estim}{An object providing the value of the outcome evaluated after
imposing a shift in the treatment. This object is passed in after being
constructed by a call to the internal function \code{est_Q}.}

\item{Hn_estim}{An object providing values of the auxiliary ("clever")
covariate, constructed from the treatment mechanism and required for
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. This object object should be passed
in after being constructed by a call to the internal function \code{est_Hn}.}

\item{fluc_method}{The method to be used in submodel fluctuation step of
the TMLE computation. The choices are "standard" and "weighted".}

\item{eif_tol}{A \code{numeric} giving the convergence criterion for the TML
estimator. This is the the maximum mean of the efficient influence function
(EIF) to be used in declaring convergence (theoretically, should be zero).}

\item{max_iter}{A \code{numeric} integer giving the maximum number of steps
to be taken in iterating to a solution of the efficient influence function.}

\item{eif_reg_type}{Whether a flexible nonparametric function ought to be
used in the dimension-reduced nuisance regression of the targeting step for
the censored data case. By default, the method used is a nonparametric
regression based on the Highly Adaptive Lasso (from package \code{hal9001}).
Set this to \code{"glm"} to instead use a simple linear regression model.
In this step, the efficient influence function (EIF) is regressed against
covariates contributing to the censoring mechanism (i.e., EIF ~ V | C = 1).}

\item{ipcw_fit_args}{A \code{list} of arguments, all but one of which are
passed to \code{est_ipcw}. For details, please consult the documentation for
\code{est_ipcw}. The first element of this (i.e., \code{fit_type}) is used
to determine how this regression is fit: "glm" for generalized linear model,
"sl" for a Super Learner, and "fit_spec" a user-specified input of the form
produced by \code{est_ipcw}. NOTE THAT this first argument is not passed to
\code{est_ipcw}.}

\item{ipcw_efficiency}{Whether to invoke an augmentation of the IPCW-TMLE
procedure that performs an iterative process to ensure efficiency of the
resulting estimate. The default is \code{TRUE}; set to \code{FALSE} to use
an IPC-weighted loss rather than the IPC-augment influence function.}
}
\value{
S3 object of class \code{txshift} containing the results of the
 procedure to compute a TML estimate of the treatment shift parameter.
}
\description{
This is the primary user-facing wrapper function to be used in invoking the
procedure to obtain targeted maximum likelihood / targeted minimum loss-based
estimates (TMLE) of the causal parameter discussed in Díaz and van der Laan
(2013) and Díaz and van der Laan (2018).
